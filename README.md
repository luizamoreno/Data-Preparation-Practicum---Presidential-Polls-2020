# Project Title

Presidential Polls 2020 Data Cleaning/Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the 2020 presidential polls data, exploring trends and patterns in voter preferences. The dataset includes information from two sources, dataframe1 and dataframe2, both extracted from the "Presidential Polls 2020" Excel file. The aim of the project is to get the dataset ready for deep analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved addressing various issues, such as converting the "start date" to a numeric date format, handling missing values, and converting relevant columns to the appropriate data types. The cleaning methods were chosen to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Combining Datasets

Datasets dataframe1 and dataframe2 were combined into a single dataset, named merged_dataframe, using the state variable as the common key. The merging process aimed to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

## Visualizations

Two visualizations were created to provide insights into the dataset. The first visualization presents the distribution of percentage votes for a specific candidate, offering an understanding of voter preferences. The second visualization, a boxplot, identifies outliers in sample sizes, crucial for statistical analysis.

## Comments in Code

Code comments were added throughout the script to explain the rationale behind each step. Comments address data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization interpretation.

## GitHub Repository Structure

The repository includes the R code file, a README.md file, and the original datasets. The README.md file serves as a guide, providing an overview of the project, details about the datasets, and a step by step guide into the actions that were taken in the data cleaning process.

## Code Checks

Spelling and formatting issues in column names were checked and addressed to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Final Remarks

The data cleaning and analysis process aimed to create a reliable dataset for exploring trends in the 2020 presidential polls. The visualizations and code structure enhance understanding and reproducibility and aimed in the data cleaning proecss.
